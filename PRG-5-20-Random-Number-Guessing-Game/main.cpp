//  Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the
//  number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should
//  display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the
//  program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that
//  repeats until the user correctly guessees the random number.
